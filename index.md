## About
ensmallen is a C++ header-only library for mathematical optimization.

The library provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an 
objective function to optimize, and also a large set of standard and 
cutting-edge optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical 
optimization task. These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, 
small-batch techniques, gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.
